# Flow Farm Employee Client - Development Context

## Quick Reference

**Project Type**: Rust + Tauri Native Desktop Application
**Primary Language**: Rust (backend) + HTML/CSS/JS (minimal frontend)
**Framework**: Tauri 2.0 (NOT React, NOT web-based)
**Target Platform**: Windows Desktop Application

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development with hot reload
cargo tauri dev

# Check code before changes
cargo check

# Run tests
cargo test

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint code
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Production build
cargo tauri build
```

## Project Context

This is an **employee management desktop application** that:

- Provides native GUI using Tauri framework
- Handles device automation via ADB
- Manages employee tasks and workflows
- Synchronizes with Flow Farm server backend
- Runs as a standalone Windows desktop application

## Key Principles

1. **Native First**: This is NOT a web application - it's a native desktop app
2. **Rust Backend**: All business logic is in Rust (`src-tauri/src/`)
3. **Minimal Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS is only for UI rendering
4. **Security**: Use Tauri's secure patterns for all operations
5. **Performance**: Leverage Rust's performance for heavy operations

## When Working on This Project

- Always verify current state with `cargo check`
- Use Rust solutions for business logic
- Use Tauri commands for frontend-backend communication
- Follow Rust conventions and error handling patterns
- Test thoroughly with `cargo test` before committing

## Architecture Reminder

```
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
    ↓ Tauri Commands
Backend (Rust)
    ↓ API Calls
Flow Farm Server
    ↓ Database
SQLite/Server DB
```
